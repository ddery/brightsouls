  In this chapter we will discuss some of the necessary elements of
a game. Some of these ideas are going to seem very obvious to you,
but you would be surprised at how often the obvious is overlooked.
I'll start by listing the elements of a good game, and then I want
you to get to work. When you have your game up and running, come
back and look at this check list. Make sure you didn't miss anything
important.

     Believe it or not, the first game I wrote (back in 1987) didn't
have one of these. I don't know why, I just forgot it. Put a title 
screen on your game. Title screens are important, because they set
the mood for the whole game. This is where you make your first
impression. Make it nice.
<p>

    If you don't know where to begin working on your game, this is a good
place to start. If you can display a title screen, that means you have
leaped over some major hurdles. You have created your first piece of
artwork, using some kind of paint or art program. You have set the
video mode to a graphics mode. You have displayed the graphic in the
chosen video mode. Congratulations, you have accomplished something.

file, don't panic. Grab a copy of <a href="http://www.fastgraph.com/">

    ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS give yourself credit. Do it even if you are humble.
Do it because I am telling you to do it. 
    <p>

    You may put credits wherever it artistically suits your fancy.
Credits can go on a screen by themselves, or on the title screen, or
on an exit screen, or on all three places. They should go in the
manual too.  More about this in <a href="https://www.fastgraph.com/makegames/chapt8.html">Chapter 8</a>.
    </p></b><p><b>

    Give everybody who worked on your game credit, within reason.
Your artist and musician should definitely get credit. If a beta
tester is particularly helpful, you might mention him with a "special
thanks to". It is not necessary to give your tools credit, unless you
feel they are especially wonderful. Some people give Fastgraph credit
in their games, but most people do not. If you use  a particularly
good rendering program to create your artwork, you can mention it if
you like. It is not customary to give credit to Microsoft for the
operating system, or to Borland or Watcom for the compiler. But
otherwise, giving credit where it is due generates goodwill, and tends
to come back to you.

    Some kind of intro sequence greatly helps many types of games.

    Be careful when using elaborate introductions, though. They tend
to get old. Allow the user to press a key to bypass the intro

option of viewing the intro again, perhaps by selecting a menu item.
Give the user a chance to impress his friends by running through the

around and clear the board by matching pairs. The game would play the

a story about magicians and their apprentices, and a mythical land

    By this I mean something as simple as a CRC check to ensure the
integrity of the high scores file. You may want to do this even when
there seems to be no obvious need for it. At some time in the
future you may want to run a contest as marketing promotion. Your users
can email their high scores files to you, and you can check them
for integrity. That way you will know if the user is cheating or if he
legitimately beat the boss enemy in less than 13 seconds.

     It is not necessary to spend a lot of money on packaging a
shareware program. Unlike a product sold in a retail store, the
customer will not see the packaging until he has already bought
the product. An expensive box with glossy graphics will not
increase your sales.

    Virtually all games, shareware and retail, have web pages. Some
authors start their web pages before the game is finished, and
provide blow-by-blow progress reports as the game is developed. Some
authors are better at making web pages than they are at making games.
Regardless, you should plan on having at least some kind of web page
for your game. It will serve as a marketing tool, as well as a place
to refer potential customers, team members, investors and publishers.

  So you probably thought all you needed to write a game was a fast
game engine that did a few tricks like z-buffering and flicker-free
scrolling, didn't you?  Admit it, you did a few fast blits and you
thought you were well on your way to being a game developer. Well
study this list again. There is a long way to go between making a
game engine and making a game.
  <p>

  But don't get discouraged. You can do it. It may take you a little
longer than you expected, but your goal is achievable. Lots of other
people have done it, and you can do it too. And guess what? It gets
easier with practice. Many of the above elements are reuseable, as is
much of the code you write. That's why I recommend your first game be
something simple. Get a feel for what kind of effort it takes to put
the whole package together, and try not to get bogged down in any
single aspect of development.
  </p></b><p><b>

After you write your first game, don't stop. It is already time to
get started on your second game. For some tips on that, consult <a href="https://www.fastgraph.com/makegames/chapt6.html">Chapter 6.</a>
